# Demo App
## Introduction

Demo APP mainly demonstrates the SDK development process. Before developing the APP, it is recommended to complete the operation of the Demo App according to this document.

After completing the [Preparation for Integration](https://tuyainc.github.io/tuyasmart_home_android_sdk_doc/en/resource/Preparation.html) chapter, you will get the AppKey, AppSecret, and security picture information used by the SDK. When integrating the SDK, please confirm that the AppKey, AppSecret, and security pictures are consistent with the information on the platform. Any mismatch will cause the SDK to be unusable.
